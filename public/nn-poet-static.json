Sitting, there for years through all the generations Watching as love lost, left Right glances at a young woman's chest Hands held, sentiment expressed Through fried food wrapped in paper then paper No news is good news Imagine the joy of moments expressed down the promenades Cracked concrete stress The sign says come in we’re open, with a small unwritten caveat, if you are It’s hard to be welcome with a stench of fat, cross the door matt, dirty But the coffee made sure, for sure, has been warming for as long as Margaret’s thoughts Open for what, for who It’s true, she feels she hasn't a clue  What she once knew has wandered long to promenade new You? I’ve sat, watched as shops fell flat, arcades flashed then crashed Kebab wrappers flew past frozen puddles all the while looking out to others Across groyne slipped down revetments held back by seaside tat The seaview you have to give back as the plaster needs to be repaired from all its cracks The window draught A final thought at the bench as bought and Margaret slips to another walk I’d be laughing myself, except it’s not funny."

Arms are flapping, they’re racing to place, all nation's egotists back into place. Where once stood common purpose, now beam signs of self interest, from platforms increasingly binary in basis of thought. [at best]",

If you were here now, what would you suggest; could concrete steps we take to address, to suggest a middle way, a liberal best.

As memories fade, hope we can see in children, the young those of mind free.

A source of national pride, shaded corners of rooms — all not well, drilled through. There’s a terrible stench, from this Halibut Urn. A great nation of States with empty plates, looks to the vessel, make it great. Must be a fish head left, the only thing not burnt from the fishing trip up at the lodge.

By fighting with reason, backed by a critically acclaimed season, we can instil a sense in us all; that walls raised by ignorant glances with mortar of rants, jingoistics chants shared at length in the name of free speech, which, by the way seems never to have cost so much to all. Will not cast a die solid pig or wrought with danger, [balance no stranger.]",
                           "Education fell on missteps like many another whose rules are a frown. As you do say it can not succeed with liberty wild, authority still needed to gather the crowd, but often true purpose is lost in amongst, desire to smarten, learners tide up with colour of houses. Made to dance on tables that measure success, instead stress the importance of breadth, to see all the sides explore free in the middle, no soul pushed to extremes to live at the seams where hate gleams… through LED beams.",
                           "The keepers of spirit are no longer in houses built tall by the hands of the s[ca][ac]red. The individuals in the collective Mass have shown themselves ill-equipped to care for, or share all. Those who profess to possess the divine right themselves, have been proven to care not for the flock but more the frock, once elaborate dress dropped, we all stand shocked, cassock hide it can not the horrors it failed to stop. The damage caused is magnitude to the power of [shock.]",
                           "While seeking a new definition, a relevance, when heads were turned to secular convenience, it now finds itself leaderless in any administrative, spiritually vital sense. As spirits run wild with vigour the church can't seem to figure if there’s a way to get any bigger. Retracting from its congregation; through assets sales, denials, fake smiles, it wakes up to the dawning of truth that of, all the betrayals theirs is greatest for on their ring they demand our kiss falls",
                           "Improve I can not, on the summary of others. It's simple and true that to get us all through there is one fundamental thing we all need. Sadly we seem to have gotten a little bit lost, although not forgotten. So I’ll restate it here for you, and hope it rings true to all 25 countries anew that what they said was true. Love is the drug… for me, for them, for all, for You."
